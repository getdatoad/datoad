# Datoad

**Intelligent API routing that cuts your LLM costs 30–45% — no code changes**

---

## 🚨 The Problem: Most teams overspend on LLM usage

Companies use GPT-4 for everything — even simple queries that cheaper models handle perfectly.

- **~70% of API calls are over-provisioned**
- **SQL/analytics queries cost 5–10× more than necessary**
- **No visibility into cost-per-query optimization opportunities**

### Your situation:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current monthly spend | **$50,000** |
| Over-provisioned | **~$18,000 (36%)** |
| Wasted annually | **$216,000** |

> *"We discovered 60% of our queries could run on cheaper models with identical results."*
> **— Head of Data Engineering, B2B SaaS Company**

## ✅ The Solution: Cognitive Routing

Datoad sits between your code and LLM providers. For each request:

1. **Analyzes** query complexity and requirements
2. **Routes** to the optimal model automatically
3. **Validates** SQL with dry-run cost estimation
4. **Tracks** savings vs. baseline in real-time

### Key principle:
> *Maximize quality, minimize cost per request.*

### Flow:
```
💻 Your App  →  📡 Datoad API  →  ⚙️ Policy Engine  →  ✓ Optimal Model
```

**Policy Engine balances:**
Speed ⚡ ←→ Accuracy 🎯 ←→ Cost 💰
*(Your custom weights)*

**No code changes required** — just swap your API endpoint.

## How We Optimize

Datoad uses **real-time policy evaluation**: each request is routed to the lowest-cost model that meets your quality threshold.

### Routing Strategy:

- **Simple QA** → GPT-3.5 or Mistral *(60% cheaper)*
- **SQL/Analytics** → Mistral *(70% cheaper than GPT-4)*
- **Complex reasoning** → Stays on GPT-4 *(quality first)*
- **Doc summarization** → GPT-3.5 *(60% cheaper)*

SQL/Analytics tasks are validated with dry-run cost estimation before execution.
